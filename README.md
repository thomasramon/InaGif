# InaGif

InaGif is a macOS application that allows users to search for GIFs from their toolbar. The app is designed to be lightweight, running directly from the macOS menu bar, and provides a simple interface for searching and copying GIFs to the clipboard. This is my first app, and it is in SuperDuperAlpha.

If you hate the built in #images for imessages like I do, this app is what you "may" be looking for.

UPDATED FEATURES:
TOGGLE BETWEEN GIF VIEWS (2 PER ROW V. 5 PER ROW)
ADDED RECENT SEARCHES ( CAN CLICK AND INSTANTLY SEARCH)
APP NOW POPS OVER FULL SCREEN WINDOWS

VISUAL CHANGES:
NEW ICON- OLD ONE IS UHHH OLD AND JUST WA PLACE HOLDER
UPDATED SPACING BETWEEN ITEMS, CREATING A MORE COMPACT VIEW.
